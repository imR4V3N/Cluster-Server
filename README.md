# Cluster

The Java project consists of an application that uses Dijkstra's algorithm or breadth traversal to find the nearest site from a server. Here is a short description of the main features :

1. **Nearest site search** : The application allows the user to specify their current location or retrieve it automatically, then uses Dijkstra's algorithm or breadth traversal to find the nearest site from a list of sites stored on a server .
2. **Using Dijkstra's algorithm or breadth traversal** : The application offers the possibility to choose between the Dijkstra algorithm, ideal for weighted graphs, or the width traversal, suitable for unweighted graphs, to calculate the shortest path to the nearest site.
3. **Swing Display** : Search results are displayed to the user using a user-friendly Swing GUI. This interface presents the shortest path to the nearest site.
4. **Friendly interactions** : The user interface allows the user to enter their location, select the algorithm to use, and provides clear visual feedback on the search result.

In summary, this Java project combines the power of path finding algorithms with a friendly graphical user interface to help users efficiently find the nearest site from a server.

The project was developed on visual studio code using the Java 17 language and swingx-all librairie [SwingX-all.jar](https://jar-download.com/artifacts/org.swinglabs.swingx/swingx-all/1.6.4/source-code)
